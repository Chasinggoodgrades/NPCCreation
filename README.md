# NPC Creation

### Download .exe
https://github.com/Chasinggoodgrades/NPCCreation/releases/tag/publish


### Required:
- 3.3.5a MySQL Server
- Works for TrinityCore only
- Expansion: WOTLK


### Purpose
- Shortens the process of handfully creating SQL queries and instead will make them for you.
- Most other NPC Creators are out of date and while this one has much less functionality, it brings a much easier way to implement NPC's into your database.

### How to use it
- Firstly, setup your server configurations in the top left "settings" option.
- By default, it'll be set to the following:

| Credentials| Input    |
| -----------|---------:|
| host       | localhost|
| port       | 3306     |
| user       | root     |
| password   | ascent   |
| database   | world    |

- After you've setup your server configurations, type/select the relative field information.
- One of the fields is "modelid1", since knowing what id you want off the top of your head can be difficult, there is a search button that will allow you to filter out models based on their name.

- Once complete, you'll have two options.. You can have the program insert it into your database for you, or simply copy the SQL query to your clipboard.
